Details
=======

Harvest is an amazing web based time tracking utility from Iridesco. They 
offer a clean Web interface, a Dashboard widget, and an API. However, I didn't 
want to have to retype all of my clients, projects, and tasks twice. I was 
already keeping track of all of these items in Things for Mac. And when 
recording time, I want to record against the actual task from Things that I 
was working on. So, this gem was created as a way to take the project and tasks
from Things and push them into Harvest via the API. 

A typical workflow then becomes. Task gets created in Things and assigned to a 
project. That project belongs to an area of responsibility. Syncing to Harvest 
can become really easy. This gem assumes that "Areas of Responsibility" in 
Things represent "clients" in Harvest. Projects in Things are projects in 
Harvest. Tasks belong to projects whether in Things or Harvest. The image 
below shows how these three items match up.
